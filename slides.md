* I do Rust things for work
    * intersection of Rust and WebAssembly
    * make fast things
    * make robust/reliable things
* create tools
    * w/ good developer experiences

    * help others build fast/robust/reliable things
* I love my job!
    * Serious Business

    * side projects in Rust for fun
    * but: semi related to work --> become part of work
* realized: just working all the time

* glaze: whole > parts
    * element of surprise
        * before firing: dull/chalky
        * after: glassy and colorful
    * combine glazes: mixing / layering
        * discovered: black on top of green, then
          * metallic and shimmery; oil slick
          * neither glaze alone had property
          * combine --> something new/surprising _emerges_
          * tried: recreate w/ five bowls
          * only one survived
* b/c pottery is difficult / requires patience
    * can break at every step
    * no undo / version control
    * part of craft: impressive!
* personal realization:
    * despite things about pottery that I enjoyed,
    * more frustrated by difficulty than relaxing / having fun

    * pen can't draw Euclidean lines w/ zero area
    * different pens
        * width
        * color
        * ballpoint vs fountain vs markers vs gel
    * ink bleeds
        * move the pen slower --> more bleeding
    * colors combine
        * blue on yellow --> unique green
    * this piece by Paul Rickards
        * takes advantage of medium superbly

    * plotters don't support all SVG features that software renderers do
* software renderers:
    * fill in shapes with colors or gradients
        * w/ plotter: need to create cross-hatch pattern
    * draw elements in order
        * later elements can occlude earlier elements
        * w/ plotter:
            * draw first element
            * then draw second element,
            * result = elements drawn on top of each other
        * if want occlusion:
            * only generate paths that aren't covered
* stop line when it hits another line?
* running into these problems?
    * consider library / framework

.headnote[Source: [Wikipedia](ohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif)]

???

* which makes a lot of sense, since you can create a voronoi diagram by flood
  filling outwards from each of the seeds at the same time
* which is intuitively similar to how a crystal grows outward until it runs into
  another crystal

---

```
let seeds = random_points(N);
for _ in 0..M {
    let p = random_point();
    let c = find_closest(p, &seeds);
    draw_line(p, c);
}
```

???

* we can use our understanding of voronoi diagrams to help create a Rust program
  for generating crystal-inspired art
* initially, we choose `N` random points to be our seeds
* and then we choose `M` random points and for each one, draw a line to its
  closest seed
* these lines should give the "exploding" aesthetic that the original crystal
  photo has

  black-and-white, via changing the length of the lines based on the angle from
  the seed

# .purple[Copy Something]

???

* "good artists copy; great artists steal"
    * since I'm new to this, I'll settle for "good"
* but I think the lesson here is to find inspiration in something and then try to copy it
    * this can actually be some plotter art made by someone else
        * maybe vintage plotter art from the 1960s
    * or it could be translating something that isn't related to computers at
      all into the plotter medium

# .yellow[Frustration:]
## My feedback loop is .blue[too slow]

???

* earlier, I presented the process as:
    * write a rust program
    * use it to generate an SVG
    * plot the SVG
* this was a simplified view, notably it doesn't take into account that we don't
  write perfect programs on the first try
      * sometimes people say of Rust or other languages with strong type
        systems: "if it compiles, then it works"
      * unfortunately this doesn't really apply, since I haven't found a way to
        encode my aesthetic taste into somthing that the borrow checker can
        enforce at compile time
* what's really happening is that there's a feedback loop where:
    * I look at the SVGs generated by my program
    * and then decide to tweak the program
    * and then I look at the new SVGs generated by my program
    * tweak the program again
    * etc... until I'm happy with the output and decide to plot it
* this feedback loop is too slow and involves a lot of manual work on my part:
    * edit the sources
    * compile the program
    * if there are no compilation errors, then I run the program
    * if it runs OK, then I alt-tab to Firefox
    * refresh to see the newest SVG
    * alt-tab back to Emacs
    * repeat

<cite><a href="https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-10-13-infrastructure-of-art.html">Tips for Generative Infrastructure and Tooling</a> by Benjamin Kovach:</cite>

> ### Rendering new images on any source change
>
> When I make a change in a file, I expect to see the result of that change as
> soon as possible, without doing anything extra.

???

* luckily Benjamin Kovach wrote a great article on tooling and infrastructure
  for generative art, laying out how to solve this problem (and others)!
    * Use a file watcher --> automatically recompile and rerun on every change
    * if recompiles OK && generates SVG OK then
        * save image as `images/<timestamp>.svg`
        * symlink as `images/latest.svg`
        * make a git commit of everything: images and code
            * This way you never lose any image you ever generate and you also
              have the code that generated the image, if you want to go back and
              riff on a different theme from what you did the first time
* I thought these tips were really great
    * especially about saving all images you ever generate
    * and this did speed up my feedback loop a little bit
* _however:_ it didn't solve the problem. my feedback loop is _still_ too slow:
    * I'm not manually kicking off compiles and running the program
      anymore,
    * but I'm still
        * waiting on compiles,
        * alt-tab'ing to Firefox,
        * refreshing to see the latest SVG,
        * alt-tab'ing back to Emacs,
    * and it is frustrating because it seems like my changes are usually small
      things, like:
        * what if there were 9 rows and columns instead of 5?
        * what if gravity was half as strong?

## Types of Changes

<img alt="Graph of types of changes" src="images/types-of-changes.svg"/>

???

* so I actually took a random sample of commits from one of my pieces and
  categorized their changes. they all fit into three categories:
    * "algorithmic" changes = things that actually change something about the
      algorithm of the code
    * "constant" changes = tweaking a constant value, e.g. changing the std
      dev. of some normal distribution I'm using
    * "formatting" changes = essentially I just ran `rustfmt`
* I'm spending most of my time waiting on compiles for tweaking *constants*?!
    * I already knew this deep down, but to having empirical evidence, it just
      blows my mind

---

```
fart::user_const! {
    const NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES: usize = 1234;
}
```

???

* so I invented this brand new thing which I call "user constants"
    * they let me tweak constant values in between runs of the program without
      recompiling it
    * you might know them by the name "environment variables"

---

<img class="centermiddle" alt="The fart local server and UI in action" src="images/fart-in-action.png"/>

???

* but "user constants" aren't _just_ environment variables
* there's also a local server that goes with them
    * the local server has a web UI with a form widget dynamically created for
      each user constant
        * these are over on the bottom left
    * tweak the constant --> POST request to the local server
    * which updates the environment variable
    * re-runs the program
    * and pushes the generated SVG back the web UI so the preview is refreshed
      automatically
* additionally, I'm running split screen with emacs so I don't need to do any
  alt-tab'ing anymore

---

## .green[Edit] <br/> .strike[Compile] <br/> .green[Run] <br/> .strike[Alt-Tab to Firefox] <br/> .strike[Refresh] <br/> .strike[Alt-Tab back to Emacs] <br/> .green[Repeat]

???

* now, for constant tweaking, which was ~60% of the changes that I make, the
  feedback loop's critical path is just edit the constant and look at the
  updated image in practice
    * the program does need to be re-run, but it happens automatically and I'm
      not waiting around for it to finish
    * the previous screenshot says it took just under 10 milliseconds to run the
      program and generate the SVG, which is barely perceptible
* with this setup, my feedback loop is finally near-instantaneous

---

<img class="centermiddle" alt="Crumpled ribbons" src="images/crumpled-ribbons.jpeg"/>

???

* The result is I am able to explore more ideas faster than I previously could
* I'm making new pieces I'm increasingly happy with, such as this one
* and at the end of the day:
    * I have a hobby that isn't work
    * that I can do just for me,
    * I'm having fun making algorithmic art with Rust and then bringing it into
      the physical world with my pen plotter

???

* here are a few resources that I've found helpful while learning about
  generative art and pen plotters
* I know I'm missing a bunch of things here
    * it wouldn't be possible to fit everything on one slide,
    * but also unfortunately I wasn't taking notes the whole time
* I hope my story has inspired some of you to try your hand at this stuff or
  maybe pottery
* I think a lot of the take aways are generally applicable even if you aren't
  doing art, but just professional programming:
    * define constraints to make a problem smaller and easier to solve
    * copy something to learn more about it, or to cross pollinate ideas from
      another field
    * analyze your feedback loop and iteration times, gather empirical evidence,
      treat it as a profiling and optimization problem and buil custom tooling
      to boost your productivity
