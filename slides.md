* before art+Rust, share journey of how got here

* I do Rust things for work
    * intersection of Rust and WebAssembly
    * make fast things
    * make robust/reliable things
* create tools
    * w/ good developer experiences
    * supporting many use cases
    * help others build fast/robust/reliable things
* I love my job!
    * Serious Business
* in my spare time?
    * side projects in Rust for fun
    * but: semi related to work --> become part of work
* realized: just working all the time
* not a recipe for a well-rounded life

* glaze: whole > parts
    * element of surprise
        * before firing: dull/chalky
        * after: glassy and colorful
    * combine glazes: mixing / layering
        * discovered: black on top of green, then
            * metallic and shimmery; oil slick
            * neither glaze alone had property
            * combine --> something new/surprising _emerges_
        * tried: recreate w/ five bowls
            * only one survived
* b/c pottery is difficult / requires patience
    * can break at every step
    * no undo / version control
    * part of craft: impressive!
* personal realization:
    * despite things about pottery that I enjoyed,
    * more frustrated by difficulty than relaxing / having fun

* "generative/algorithmic art" = write programs to generate images/animations/music

    * generative artists programming simple rules --> emergent behavior, bigger
      than any single rule
        * *Process 13 (A)* by Casey Reas
            * circles moving behind scenes
              * not drawn directly
            * circles touching --> draw a line
        * no code says "draw trellises"
            * emerge from process to surprise / delight us
* however:
    * could appreciate; not overcome w/ urge to make
    * nothing physical

* physical medium = more emergence:
    * more variables
    * pen can't draw Euclidean lines w/ zero area
    * different pens
        * width
        * color
        * ballpoint vs fountain vs markers vs gel
    * ink bleeds
        * move the pen slower --> more bleeding
    * colors combine
        * blue on yellow --> unique green
    * get same element of surprise as w/ glaze
    * this piece by Paul Rickards
        * takes advantage of medium superbly
        * rectangles overlap / colors combine --> transparency / depth
* _this physicality_ = what was missing
* decision:
    * make algorithmic art
    * bring into physical world w/ pen plotter
* bought AxiDraw, popular pen plotter

    * blows my mind

```
fart::user_const! {
    const NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES: usize = 1234;
}
```

???

* wanted:
    * change constant values between runs
    * w/out re-compiling
* invented brand new thing: "user constants"
    * might know by name "environment variables"

---

<pre><code class="text remark-code"><span class="purple">$ fart serve</span>
Serving on <span class="yellow">http://localhost:9090</span>
</code></pre>

???

* but "user constants" aren't _just_ environment variables
* local server that goes with them

???

* the local server has a web UI
* for each user constant program uses:
    * form input dynamically created
    * these are over on the bottom left
* tweak the constant --> POST request to the local server
* which updates the environment variable
* re-runs the program
* pushes generated SVG back to web UI
    * preview refreshed automatically

???

* additionally: split screen w/ emacs
    * simple, effective: "window management"
    * edit code --> live preview
    * no more alt-tab'ing, even for algorithmic changes

???

* for constant tweaking, ~60% of changes, critical path:
    * edit constant
    * look at updated image
* technically, need re-run
    * but happens automatically
    * not waiting around for run to finish
        * prev screenshot: < 10 ms
        * barely perceptible
* feedback loop is finally near-instantaneous

???

* result:
    * explore more ideas
    * faster than previously could
* making new pieces
    * increasingly happy with
    * Crumpled Ribbons
* end of day:
    * hobby != work
    * just for me,
    * having fun making algorithmic art
        * w/ Rust
        * bringing into physical world w/ pen plotter

???

* hope story inspired
* take aways generally applicable
    * not just art; also professional programming
* define constraints
    * make problem smaller
    * easier to solve
    * break down into pieces
* want to learn something?
    * copy it
    * cross pollinate by copying from another domain
* want to boost efficiency?
    * treat iteration time as optimization problem
    * profile & gather empirical evidence
    * customize your tools & build custom tooling
