*** Act 1
**** _Inciting Incident_
***** Protagonist's regular life interrupted
***** Kicks off series of events leading to climax
***** Presents a challenge, leading protagonist to create a goal
***** Protagonist is trying to achieve this goal for the rest of the story
**** _Turning Point 1_
***** Protagonist decides to go on the adventure
***** Conscious decision to pursue further
*** Act 2
**** Escalating series of events during struggle to accomplish goal
**** _Mid Point_
***** Protagonist realizes that they cannot turn back
***** Continuing now easier than giving up
**** _Turning Point 2_
***** Culmination of second act
***** Protagonist is (temporarily) defeated
***** Outlook is bleak
*** Act 3
**** Climax
***** Protagonist's final battle
***** Twist that enables protagonist to win or overcome previous mistakes
***** Results in protagonist fulfilling goal created by the inciting incident
**** Resolution
** Eight-Point Arc

*** 1. Stasis
**** Every-day life; routine
*** 2. Trigger
**** Event that sparks the story
**** Beyond the control of the protagonist
*** 3. Quest
**** Result of the trigger
**** Creates protagonist's goal to fix whatever went wrong in the trigger
*** 4. Surprise
**** Obstacles, complications, and conflict for protagonist
**** The protagonist is growing and learning
*** 5. Critical Choice
**** Reveals the character of the protagonist
**** Actual choice, not accidental
*** 6. Climax
**** Result of the critical choice
**** Highest tension in story
*** 7. Reversal
**** Consequence of the climax (and therefore also critical choice)
**** Should result in a change of the protagonist
*** 8. Resolution
**** The new stasis
**** A new routine life
**** Wiser characters; goal laid out in quest achieved
* My talk in the myth structure
** Stasis
*** Rust day job
*** Pottery as artistic escape hatch
** Inciting Incident / Trigger
*** Pottery going bad; no undo :(
*** can I think of a particular piece exploding in the kiln?
** Turning Point 1 / Quest
*** Decision to make generative plotter art with Rust
*** Buy an axidraw
** Mid Point
*** how to use a pen plotter?
**** SVG
**** saxi
*** what is generative art?
**** similarities with pottery
***** emergent effects
***** infinitely deep
*** First crystal
**** how it is made
** Turning Point 2 / Surprise
*** Iteration / feedback loop still really slow
*** Tooling based on @bendotK's post
**** TODO: find it and link it
*** <insert sample/analysis of commits>
** Climax
*** Need to build `fart serve` and `fart::user_const!`
*** Tide
** Reversal
*** I am now more productive
**** More crystals
***** Made in fraction of the time of others
**** More other pieces
***** polygons-in-contact -> disarray
***** Line fields?
** Resolution
*** No longer limited by feedback loop and turnaround times
*** Focusing on art rather than methods
*** Art and math intertwined
*** Find quote about "is there enough art? only you would make your art, so it is worth it" thing
**** I think by Niel Gaiman?!
* More of inspiration for different pieces rather than excruciating details of algorithm
** looking at nature, microscopy, etc
* Similarities / metaphors between pottery and generative art / pen plotters
** infinitely deep
** process based
** using a kick wheel rather than a motorized wheel; using old pen plotters rather than new ones
** emergent behavior in generative art; emergent patterns in glaze combinations / overlaps
** do the same thing twice, get two similar yet different outcomes
*** rng seeds
*** small differences in clay / temperature / whatever
