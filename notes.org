*** 1. Stasis
**** Every-day life; routine
*** 2. Trigger
**** Event that sparks the story
**** Beyond the control of the protagonist
*** 3. Quest
**** Result of the trigger
**** Creates protagonist's goal to fix whatever went wrong in the trigger
*** 4. Surprise
**** Obstacles, complications, and conflict for protagonist
**** The protagonist is growing and learning
*** 5. Critical Choice
**** Reveals the character of the protagonist
**** Actual choice, not accidental
*** 6. Climax
**** Result of the critical choice
**** Highest tension in story
*** 7. Reversal
**** Consequence of the climax (and therefore also critical choice)
**** Should result in a change of the protagonist
*** 8. Resolution
**** The new stasis
**** A new routine life
**** Wiser characters; goal laid out in quest achieved

*** Flatulence, Crystals, and Happy Little Accidents
Nick Fitzgerald
RustConf 2019
**** hi
**** thanks for coming to my talk about algorithmic art and Rust
**** back up first
*** Rust and WebAssembly Working Group
**** make fast things
**** make robust things
**** make good developer experiences, and support many use cases, and help others make fast and robust things
**** these are good things!
**** hopefully also valuable things: enough that it pays my bills at least
**** they're even interesting and fun things!
**** but sometimes it feels like a lot of serious business
**** I was hacking on little crates and side projects for fun
***** but they had this tendency of becoming work
***** not just in the sense of being a maintainer and fielding bug reports and all that
***** but that once I'd proven out some idea in my spare time, we folded it into work
**** not a well-rounded life
*** Pottery
**** took up pottery as a hobby
**** feeling the clay with my hands and shaping it appealed to me
**** aiming to bring some art into my life
**** something that isn't for other people:
***** doesn't have stakeholders or need to support use cases
***** doesn't have to be robust
***** something that is just for me
***** something that is just for fun
*** Pottery Process
Wedge -> Throw -> Biscuit Fire -> Glaze -> Glaze Fire
**** wedge
***** like kneading bread, but opposite goal: remove air bubbles rather than introduce oxygen
**** throw
***** put clay on the pottery wheel
***** wheel spins, you shape the clay into a bowl/mug
**** biscuit fire
***** first time the pottery goes into the kiln
***** makes the piece hard, hold its shape
***** becomes porous for absorbing glaze
**** glaze
***** apply the "paint" to the piece
***** kind of chalky at this stage
***** color is kind of dull
**** glaze fire
***** finishes the piece
***** melts the glaze
***** glaze becomes glassy
***** glaze gets colorful
**** what I really liked about pottery
***** you can spend a lifetime exploring just one corner of the pottery process
****** there's so much depth to it
****** https://www.instagram.com/p/BPJEw4nhqfU/
***** for me: glaze in particular, the whole is greater than the parts
****** put a coat of white glaze on top of black glaze and it comes out green(!?!)
**** discovered that if I put TODO glaze over TODO glaze, then
***** I got something that came out metallic and shimmery,
***** almost like an oil slick
***** neither glaze alone had this property, but combine them and something new _emerges_
***** tried to recreate this with 5 bowls
***** only 1 made it through the whole process
**** pottery is very difficult and requires lots of patience
***** things can break every step of the way
***** wedging:
****** didn't get all air bubbles out -> piece will _explode_ in the kiln later
***** throwing:
****** twitch a finger / stop paying attention / do _anything_ wrong -> have to start over
***** this difficulty is part of the craft and what makes it so impressive!
***** realization:
****** despite all these things about pottery that I really enjoyed,
****** I was getting more frustrated by pottery's difficulty than I was having fun
*** Algorithmic Art
**** seen "Generative Art" and "Algorithmic Art" and "Creative Coding" around
**** TODO quick description of what this is
**** has many of the same things that I like about pottery
***** sum > parts
****** combine glazes and get a new glaze that is completely different from original glazes
****** simple rules combine -> create emergent behavior that is bigger than any of the rules alone
**** but it never quite grabbed me so tightly that I was overcome by the urge to produce it myself
**** there was still something missing:
***** nothing to hold onto; nothing physical
*** Pen Plotters
**** and then I discovered pen plotters
**** a pen plotter is a robot
***** you put a pen in its hand
***** and then you tell it to draw something
***** and it draws it
***** now you have a physical, pen and paper artifact of your algorithm!!
**** in addition to an artifact that you can hold/frame/give to someone, adds more room for emergence:
***** a pen doesn't draw perfect Euclidean lines with zero area
***** use different pens and they draw different lines
****** color
****** width
****** fountain pens
****** markers
****** gel pens
***** ink bleeds
****** move pen faster -> less bleeding
****** move pen slower -> more bleeding
***** colors combine
****** draw a blue line on top of a yellow one -> get a green that you don't even have a marker for
****** draw yellow on top of blue and it comes out different
***** the lines retain some of the imperfections of the pen,
****** the paper,
****** the table shaking as you walk by
**** _this_ is what I was missing from generative art
***** I'm hooked
**** so I made my decision:
***** I'm going to make algorithmic art
***** and I'm going to make it physical by drawing it with a pen plotter
**** so I bought a pen plotter
*** How do I use a pen plotter?
SVG -> Pen Plotter
**** Like most of you, probably, I didn't know how to use a pen plotter
***** what is the process to go from zero to drawn artifact?
**** Easiest way is to use _SVG_
***** TODO include image from wikipedia showing raster vs vector graphics
***** scalable vector graphics
***** image format
***** but instead of talking about a set of pixels, like bitmaps, jpg, or png do
***** talks about a set of shapes and lines
***** these shapes and lines are described within some abstract coordinate space
***** pen plotter can scale the SVG's coordinate space to the page it's drawing on
****** and draw these lines and shapes with the pen you give it
***** Like HTML or XML, SVG is a bunch of elements
****** in pointy brackets
****** with optional attributes to control width or color
***** How many of you know HTML or XML?
****** Raise your hands
****** Great! Everyone who raised their hand is ready to be a artist!
**** for the Axidraw, use `saxi`
***** nice Web frontend to control the plotter
***** makes getting the pen up/down height and centering on the page easy
***** can't recommend it highly enough
*** How do I generate an SVG from Rust?
Rust program -> SVG -> Pen Plotter
**** ok, so if I want to plot my own art, I need to write a program to generate an SVG
**** for me, there is no question that this program will be written in Rust
**** and this is Rust Conf, so likely its the same way for you
**** but if you prefer JavaScript or Go, then use that!
*** Use the `svg` crate
```
use svg::node::element;

let data = element::path::Data::new()
    .move_to((10, 10))
    .line_to((60, 20))
    .line_to((25, 60))
    .close();

let path = element::Path::new()
    .set("fill", "none")
    .set("stroke", "black")
    .set("stroke-width", 3)
    .set("d", data);

let document = svg::Document::new()
    .set("viewBox", (0, 0, 70, 70))
    .add(path);

svg::save("triangle.svg", &document)?;
```
**** I started out using just the `svg` crate directly
***** gives you a nice little builder-style API for creating SVGs
**** this example draws a triangle
**** the _path data_ describes a sequence of strokes in the coordinate space
***** moves the pen to `10, 10`
***** draws a line to `60, 20`, and another line from there to `25, 60`
***** the `close` draws a line back to the first point, `10, 10`
**** the _path element_ describes the styles of how the strokes should be drawn
***** these styles are ignored by the pen plotter!
***** stroke width and color are determined by what pen we give the plotter
***** useful to us when checking out what our generated SVG will roughly look like when plotted
**** finally, the _document_ is the whole SVG image
***** its _view box_ is the box in the coordinate space that we see as an image
***** can scale the view box up and down to make elements inside it smaller or larger
*** And here is the SVG that is generated!
```
<svg viewBox="0 0 70 70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M10,10 L60,20 L25,60 z"
        fill="none"
        stroke="black"
        stroke-width="3"/>
</svg>
```

*** Rectangles
```
trait Rect: Default {
    type Node: svg::node::Node;

    fn draw(
        &mut self,
        rng: &mut impl Rng,
        x: f64,
        y: f64,
        width: f64,
        height: f64,
        value: f64,
    ) -> Self::Node;
}
```
**** now that I could generate SVGs, I set out an exercise for myself
**** how many ways could I fill a rectangle?
**** parameterized by a "darkness" value
***** where 0 ~= white
***** and 1 ~= black
*** Rectangles

*** Tilings
```
trait Tiling {
    fn new(rng: &mut impl Rng, width: usize, height: usize) -> Self;

    fn get_value(&mut self, rng: &mut impl Rng, x: usize, y: usize) -> f64;
}
```
**** next I explored ways to compose these rectangles by tiling them and varying the darkness value
*** Tiling 0 of Rectangle 10
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fitzgen/rects/master/images/2019-01-19-19-02-17-359541000.png
**** _Tiling 0_ gave each rectangle a darkness value based on its y position in the tiling
***** the first row at the top had near-0 value, making it very light,
***** and then as you go down to the bottom the rectangles get darker and darker,
***** creating a gradient effect
*** Tiling 3 of Rectangle 2
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fitzgen/rects/master/images/2019-01-19-21-13-40-960604000.png
**** _Tiling 3_ assigns darkness based on how close a rectangle is to the center of the tiling
**** but then introduces a little bit of random noise to perturb the results
**** what I like about the piece
***** the kaleidoscope effect
***** almost looks like stained glass
***** this is another example of _emergent properties_ of generative art
****** created by the ways a rectangle's interior squares are positioned
****** how they happen to interact with
*** Tiling 3 of Rectangle 2; Plotted
https://twitter.com/fitzgen/status/1088241756464865280/photo/1
**** This was my favorite of the tiling exercise; so I decided to plot it
**** another surprise: lines thicker -> much darker than anticipated
**** more ghostly
*** Take Aways
**** Constraint breeds creativity
***** The hardest part is looking at a blank canvas and deciding what to do
****** side step it by giving yourself constraints and an exercise
****** and do as many things as you can within those constraints
****** maybe even just sit down and write a list of all the things that might fit those constraints first
****** and then start coding them afterwards
****** potential constraints for exercises:
******* How many ways can I fill a rectangle with some `value` of darkness?
******* How many ways can I render some sort of brush stroke, given a path of points?
******* How many ways can I visualize Perlin noise?
******* How many ways can I visualize binary numbers?
******* How many ways can I draw random walks?
****** once you have a bunch of methods for drawing within those constraints, how can you combine them?
******* How can I tile these rectangles and their darkness values?
******* Which of my brush strokes look nice when rendering Perlin noise?
******* What if I constructed a path to draw based on the intersection points of two random walks?
**** Simple combinations of simple primitives
Corollary: We don't need a framework to start making art
***** It doesn't take much to start making art
***** You don't have to learn a framework like Processing or Open Frameworks or Nannou
***** You can start *now*!
***** I did these first pieces with just the `svg` crate
****** but we don't even need that
****** could just as easily concatenate strings of SVG fragments together!
***** I mention this because learning new frameworks can be intimidating/frustrating/slow
****** and the best way to start making art is to hit the ground running
****** once you have a problem that can be solved by a framework, then reach for a framework
** Claim: Plotters Support SVG.
Verdict: *Half True*
*** https://static.politifact.com/rulings/tom-halftrue.png
*** SVG supports filling in shapes with a color or gradient
**** the pen plotter will only draw the outline of the shape
**** if you want some sort of fill, you have to add hatch lines yourself, or another pattern of lines
*** SVG elements can be assigned a Z-index
**** like HTML and CSS: elements with a higher Z-index occlude elements lower Z-index
***** ignoring transparency, you only see the element with the higher Z-index
***** whether the lower Z-index element was ever rendered or not is an impl detail of the rendering engine
****** either way we never see it
**** on the other hand: pen plotters will draw the shape underneath, and then draw the shape on top
***** if you didn't want to see the lower Z-index shape
****** then you need to figure out how to do that yourself
**** multiple ways to solve this problem, notably:
***** use ray casting to figure out what is visible to the camera
****** break every path down into epsilon-length line segments and check if anything occludes segment
****** it is imprecise, but you can make epsilon smaller than the smallest line your plotter can draw
******* so in practice it doesn't natter
****** Applies to anything you might draw with the pen plotter
******* since the pen plotter can really only draw lines
***** use Computational Geometry algorithms to find precise intersection points
****** Upside: precise answers! (If all the calculations fit in your number representation)
******* These algorithms are capital-F Fun
******* feels like you're one small chain link in a succession that leads all the way back to Euclid
******** especially when you're using the `euclid` crate
****** downside: not as generally applicable as ray casting
******* for example: different algorithms for convex vs concave shapes
*** This is a good time to either
1. Reach for a library
2. Start using a framework that does this for you
3. Decide to go down the rabbit hole and write your own library or framework
*** Fitzgen's Art
**** I decided to pursue the last option
**** started collecting comp. geom. algorithms/utilities in a collection of crates called "Fitzgen's Art"
**** "Fitzgen's Art" was too long so I decided to shorten it to "fart"
***** hence the "flatulence" part of this talk's title
** Crystals

*** Actually there's a feedback loop
**** don't write perfect programs the first time
***** "if it compiles then it works" doesn't really apply
I haven't found a way to encode my aesthetic taste into something that the
borrow checker can enforce at compile time yet
**** I'm doing a lot of
***** edit
***** compile
***** run
***** alt-tab to Firefox
***** refresh
***** alt-tab back to Emacs
***** repeat
**** feedback loop is not as fast as I'd like
*** Someone already laid out exactly how to solve this problem!

**** Use a file watcher -> recompile and rerun on every change
**** if recompiles OK && generates SVG OK then
***** save image as `images/<timestamp>.svg`

This way you never lose any image you ever generate and you also have the code
that generated the image, if you want to go back and riff on a different theme
from what you did the first time
